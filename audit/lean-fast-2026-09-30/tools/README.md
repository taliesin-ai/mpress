# Reproducing the audit

Run the source-selected Go toolchain from the repository root:

```sh
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.6.0 ./...
go build -trimpath -ldflags='-s -w' -o /tmp/mpress-audit-bin ./cmd/mpress
/tmp/mpress-audit-bin build --strict --json
/tmp/mpress-audit-bin check
go test ./internal/site -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkBuild(Cold|Warm)$' -benchmem -benchtime=3x -count=3
```

The `BenchmarkBuild*` workload writes 200 numbered pages plus a home page.
Its cold case clears the M-Press parse cache and output; the warm case clears
output after priming the parse cache. Both enable asset minification/CSS purge.

For the touch reproduction, this directory is a separate Go module so browser
tooling does not enter the production module or binary. It serves already-built
site output through a temporary local HTTP server and uses installed Chrome:

```sh
cd audit/lean-fast-2026-09-30/tools
go run . /absolute/path/to/mpress/site > mobile-results.json
```

`mobile.go` compares real touch swipes before and after an in-browser diagnostic
CSS injection. The injection does not edit repository source or site output.
The original failing baseline is preserved in `../evidence/mobile.json`.
The browser currently defaults to `/usr/bin/google-chrome`; adjust that local
path for another installation. This harness is Chromium-only.

The assertion-based popover regression check uses generated production output
without injecting CSS:

```sh
MPRESS_TOUCH_SITE=/absolute/path/to/generated/site go test -count=1 -run '^TestUtilityPopoverInteraction$' -v .
```

Run it against both accessibility-enabled and disabled builds. It checks all
utility popovers on `/configuration/` at 375x667 and 375x375: closed focus/hit
testing, open focus/hit testing, immediate and settled exit transitions, and
page scrolling after closing. Without `MPRESS_TOUCH_SITE`, this test skips;
a skip does not qualify browser behaviour. It is a focused regression, while
the broader overflow-family matrix remains Beads task `mp-b52.2.4`.

Public audit evidence is committed. Raw private conformance logs and private
fixtures are deliberately kept in the private test environment. To run that
suite, select the exact candidate explicitly with `MPRESS_SOURCE`/`MPRESS_BIN`
and supply installed browser/Axe prerequisites. A skipped check is not a pass.

To recreate the large workload, archive the pinned Wails `docs/mpress/` revision
listed in `AUDIT.md` into a disposable directory, then build there with
`--strict --no-purge-css` and run `check`. Do not modify the user's Wails checkout
or substitute a different revision without recording its provenance.

For controlled LCP/resource measurements, use the separate `lcp` program:

```sh
MPRESS_LCP_GZIP=1 go run ./lcp /absolute/path/to/generated/site 3 > lcp-results.json
MPRESS_LCP_GZIP=1 MPRESS_LCP_ROUTE=/docs/community/showcase/portfall/ go run ./lcp /absolute/path/to/legacy/build 2 > article-results.json
MPRESS_LCP_GZIP=1 go run ./lcp https://public-pages-host.example/ 1 > live-results.json
MPRESS_V3_SITE=/absolute/path/to/v3/site MPRESS_V2_SITE=/absolute/path/to/v2/build go test -count=1 -run '^TestLandingVisualContracts$' -v ./lcp
```

Each measurement uses a fresh Chrome context, disabled cache, 150ms latency,
200 KiB/s download, 4x CPU slowdown and 1365px/390px viewports in both themes.
The local server can gzip text assets; use the same setting for both builds.
It observes LCP, layout shifts, long tasks and resource timings until four
seconds after navigation finishes. An autoplay carousel may produce multiple
LCP candidates: the last observed candidate is used, not a cherry-picked first
paint. These are lab samples, not field percentiles or an entire browsing visit.

`TestLandingVisualContracts` checks generated styles, both themes, translated
no-JavaScript hero rendering, and carousel eager/lazy loading plus autoplay with
stable height at desktop/mobile widths. Missing site environment variables skip
the test; a skip does not qualify the change. See `../LCP.md` for pinned build
sources and measurement evidence. Browser dependencies remain outside M-Press's
production module.

Accessibility and contribution scrolling regressions also use production builds:

```sh
MPRESS_A11Y_SITE=/absolute/path/to/generated/site go test -count=1 -run '^TestAccessibilityViewportReachability$' -v .
MPRESS_CONTRIBUTE_SITE=/absolute/path/to/generated/site go test -count=1 -run '^TestContributionDialogPhoneReachability$' -v .
```

Both require the complete public documentation fixture with `/configuration/`.
The contribution fixture must have contributions enabled with this repository
configured, so its script/source-path assertions verify the actual site handoff.
They exercise native touch gestures and keyboard input, share clipping/gesture
primitives, and enforce independent scroll-owner checks. Missing environment
variables skip these checks. Optional `MPRESS_A11Y_REPORT` and
`MPRESS_CONTRIBUTE_REPORT` paths save JSON evidence. See `../B02.md` and `../B03.md`
for viewport coverage, original-CSS replay and test limitations.
