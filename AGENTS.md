# Current-feature quality and performance work

The user has frozen new product features. Test, fix and optimize existing behaviour.
Do not remove an existing capability to obtain a smaller binary or faster benchmark.

The active backlog is Beads epic `mp-b52`. The initial audit and task index live in
`audit/lean-fast-2026-09-30/AUDIT.md` and `TODO.md`. Use `backlog-map.json` to map
audit keys to live Beads IDs. Beads stores the authoritative statuses, dependencies
and task notes; the Markdown TODO is an index of the original scope.

At each bounded change:

1. Read `bd ready` and `bd show ID`; address confirmed P0/P1 bugs before optimizations.
2. Claim the issue with `bd update ID --status in_progress --assignee taliesin-ai`.
3. Reproduce defects and add meaningful behaviour regression checks. For an
   optimization, record a representative baseline and profile first.
4. Implement a bounded change. Preserve current contracts and unrelated user work.
5. Run affected tests, then appropriate build/race/browser/link checks. Measure
   performance on the same workload and machine. A source pattern alone is not
   evidence that an optimization helps.
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, record evidence and commit in Beads notes, and close
   only when the acceptance criteria are met. An investigation can be resolved
   with a documented evidence-based no-change decision; confirmed bugs require fixes.
7. Export the ledger to `.beads/issues.jsonl` and keep the repository snapshot
   current. Dolt remains the authoritative database; JSONL is interchange,
   not a full database backup.

Use `gh` for GitHub operations and the `taliesin-ai` profile for commits:
`taliesin-ai <281494191+taliesin-ai@users.noreply.github.com>`.
Scope Git identity to this worktree; do not change the identity of sibling branches.
Private conformance fixtures and raw private logs stay outside the public repository.

Only claim performance improvements demonstrated by repeatable before/after
measurements. Record unavailable browser/device/native-platform checks honestly.
Do not close the parent epic or final qualification task while required child work remains.
